This is an open source project that provides a starter kit for building web applications with Tailwind CSS, Laravel 10, and the Argon Pro Tailwind UI Kit.

## Introduction
The Argon Dashboard is a complex and innovative dashboard created by Creative Tim. It features bold elements and beautiful design, made up of hundreds of elements, designed blocks, and fully coded pages. The dashboard is built with over 300 frontend individual elements, like buttons, inputs, navbars, navtabs, cards, or alerts, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in color, that you can easily modify using SASS files and classes.

Splade provides a super easy way to build Single Page Applications (SPA) using standard Laravel Blade templates, enhanced with renderless Vue 3 components. With Splade, you can write your app using the simplicity of Blade and still have the full power of Vue.js. It provides features like:

Links and form submissions without full page reload
Modals and slideovers that can show any route (and support for nested modals)
Beautiful form components with Eloquent Model binding, validation, datetime picker, searchable and taggable selects, and async uploads
A DataTables-like table component that supports auto-fill, searching, filtering, sorting, toggling, and pagination
This Tailwind CSS Admin Starter Kit is based on the Argon Dashboard and Splade, and includes pre-built design blocks, making the development process seamless. You can easily switch from our pages to the real website, saving you a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code.
